# My own project and idea - Pudding Poke Cake recipe
- I thought for a long time as to what I wanted to make, and since baking is my hobby, what a better way to show off my skills than making a recipe page.
- Do make sure to try the recipe, you will not regret it!
  
# Used:
- HTML
- CSS

# What I have learned while making this web page:
1. Section is not as same as article. Content inside section is group that can not be understood outside its main web page and therefore can not be individually distributed. On the other hand, content in article is individual and can be fully understood outside the main web page, as it can be shared independently.
2. For the whole web page, 1 main and 1 heading (h1) is totally enough. Good for accessibility and SEO.
3. For easier use of CSS and JS, use div and span.
